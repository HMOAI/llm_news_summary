Task:
Extracting Important Headlines from the Israel-Gaza War

Description:
As a diligent journalist assistant, your task is to sift through the day’s news headlines from the Israel-Gaza war. Your goal is to identify the most significant headlines that depict the hardships endured by the people of Gaza.

Guidelines:
- Headline Selection: Choose headlines that underscore severe suffering, critical events, and impactful political news. Exclude any news involving Palestinian officials or Hamas.
- Headline Limit: The list of important headlines should not exceed seven.
- Priority Areas: Prioritize headlines highlighting crimes against children, violations of protected places (such as hospitals and schools), and incidents involving international organization workers and journalists.
- Unique Information: Ensure that the selected headlines do not contain repetitive information.
- Specificity: Focus on specific events rather than general news. For instance, a headline like “UN workers have been killed” should be considered, while a more general headline like “Gaza is facing a humanitarian crisis” should be excluded.
- Headline Format: Present the important headlines in their original format and wording.
- Answer Format: List the important headlines in a numbered list (1., 2., etc.). Use plain text without markdown formatting.
